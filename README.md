A self-improving Chinese-to-English translation pipeline specifically designed for web novels, combining rule-based consistency with RAG terminology precision for optimal translation quality.

## Current Status: Production-Ready Hybrid System

**Working Components:**
- **Rule Learning**: Extracts style/structure patterns from professional translations
- **Rule Application**: Applies 10 high-quality rules for consistent translation style  
- **RAG Terminology**: Vector database for exact cultivation term mappings
- **Pattern Extrapolation**: Learns cultivation patterns (realms, techniques, titles)

## Project Vision

Traditional LLM translation suffers from inconsistent terminology and style drift, especially in domain-specific content like cultivation novels. This system builds a living knowledge base that combines:

1. **Style Rules** - Learned patterns for tone, pacing, structure from professional translations
2. **Terminology RAG** - Vector database ensuring "丹帝 → Pill God" consistency
3. **Pattern Learning** - Automatic extrapolation for new terms (凝气期 → Qi Condensation stage)

## Architecture Overview

### **Hybrid Translation Pipeline**
```
Chinese Input
    ↓ (Async DeepSeek + Context Caching)
Baseline Translation 
    ↓ (Compare with Ground Truth)
Style Rules Extraction 
    ↓ (Cerebras AI Cleaning)
Clean Style Rules 
    ↓ (RAG Terminology Lookup)
RAG + Rules Enhanced Translation 
    ↓ (AI Quality Evaluation)
Quality Improvement Metrics
```

### **Example Translation Flow**

**Input Chinese:** `龙尘突破到金丹期，成为了丹帝传人`

**Step 1 - Baseline Translation:**
```
"Long Chen broke through to the Golden Core stage and became the Alchemy Emperor's successor"
```

**Step 2 - RAG Term Extraction:**
```python
extracted_terms = ["龙尘", "金丹期", "丹帝"]
rag_mappings = {
    "龙尘": "Long Chen",
    "金丹期": "Golden Core stage",  
    "丹帝": "Pill God"  # ← Corrects "Alchemy Emperor"
}
```

**Step 3 - Enhanced Translation (Rules + RAG):**
```
"Long Chen broke through to the Golden Core stage and became the Pill God's successor"
```

**Result:** Perfect terminology consistency with natural English flow

```

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
```bash
# Scrape raw Chinese chapters
python scripts/scrape/scrape.py

# Clean and process text  
python scripts/scrape/clean.py
```

### 2. Build RAG Terminology Database
```bash
# Extract term mappings from ground truth
python scripts/6_build_rag.py --extract-terms

# Build vector database for semantic similarity
python scripts/6_build_rag.py --build-vectors
```

### 3. Baseline Translation
```bash
# Translate chapters with DeepSeek API (cached prompts)
python scripts/1_baseline_translate.py --start 1 --end 10
```

### 4. Rule Learning  
```bash
# Extract style rules by comparing with ground truth
python scripts/2_extract_rules.py --start 1 --end 10

# Clean and filter rules with Cerebras AI
python scripts/3_clean_rules.py
```

### 5. Enhanced Translation (Rules + RAG)
```bash
# Re-translate with learned rules + RAG terminology
python scripts/4_enhanced_translate.py --start 1 --end 10
```

### 6. Quality Evaluation
```bash
# Comprehensive quality assessment
python scripts/5_evaluate.py --start 1 --end 10
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Hybrid Rules + RAG Architecture**
```python
# Style rules ensure consistent flow and tone
style_rules = [
    "Use punchy sentences in action scenes",
    "Maintain conversational dialogue style", 
    "Preserve Chinese paragraph breaks"
]

# RAG ensures perfect terminology
rag_lookup = {
    "丹帝": "Pill God",           # Exact mapping
    "金丹期": "Golden Core stage", # Cultivation realm
    "九星霸体诀": "Nine Star Hegemon Body Art"  # Technique name
}

# Combined prompt
prompt = f"""STYLE RULES: {style_rules}
TERMINOLOGY: {rag_lookup}
CHINESE: {input_text}"""
```

### 2. **Pattern Learning & Extrapolation**
```python
# RAG learns cultivation patterns automatically
realm_pattern = [
    "金丹期 → Golden Core stage",
    "筑基期 → Foundation Establishment stage",
    "元婴期 → Nascent Soul stage"
]

# New term: "凝气期" (never seen before)
# RAG provides pattern context → AI learns → "Qi Condensation stage"
```

### 3. **Cost-Optimized Context Caching**
```python
# Fixed prompt cached across all translations (90% cache hit rate)
CACHED_PROMPT = """TRANSLATION RULES: [10 style rules]
CORE TERMINOLOGY: [100 most common terms]"""

# Variable content per chapter (not cached)  
variable_content = f"CHAPTER TERMS: {rag_terms}\nCHINESE: {chapter}"

# Result: 60%+ cost reduction via DeepSeek context caching
```

### Example Results
```
Original Chinese: 龙尘看着那个丹帝传承，心中涌起一股金丹期的力量

Baseline Translation:
"Long Chen looked at the Alchemy Emperor's inheritance, feeling Golden Core stage power surge in his heart"

Enhanced (Rules + RAG):
"Long Chen gazed at the Pill God's inheritance, feeling Golden Core stage power surge through him"

Improvements:
- "Alchemy Emperor" → "Pill God" (RAG terminology)
- "looked at" → "gazed at" (style rules)  
- "in his heart" → "through him" (natural flow)
```

## Cost Analysis

**Per Chapter Costs** (with caching optimization):
- **Input tokens (cache hit)**: ~4K × $0.014/1M = $0.000056
- **Input tokens (cache miss)**: ~2K × $0.27/1M = $0.00054  
- **Output tokens**: ~4K × $1.10/1M = $0.0044
- **Total per chapter**: ~$0.005

**At Scale:**
- **1,000 chapters**: ~$5 total cost
- **Time to process**: ~33 hours (30 chapters/hour)
- **Quality**: Professional-grade consistency

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
echo "CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env

# 2. Build RAG database
python scripts/6_build_rag.py

# 3. Run complete pipeline
python scripts/1_baseline_translate.py
python scripts/2_extract_rules.py

```

## Why This Approach Works

### vs. Simple LLM Translation
- **Consistency**: RAG ensures "丹帝" always becomes "Pill God"
- **Quality**: Style rules maintain professional translation standards
- **Context**: Understands cultivation novel conventions

### vs. Traditional CAT Tools  
- **Intelligence**: Learns patterns, not just exact matches
- **Adaptability**: Self-improves from ground truth examples
- **Scale**: Handles novel-length content efficiently with caching

### vs. Human Translation
- **Speed**: 30+ chapters/hour vs 1-2 chapters/day
- **Availability**: 24/7 operation with consistent quality
- **Consistency**: Never forgets established terminology or style rules
- **Cost**: $0.005/chapter vs $50-200/chapter for human translation
- **Quality**: Matches professional standards with learned rules + RAG
